I am a Problem Solver using data analytics to support making better and data-driven business decisions (not necessarily for the private sector).

I am self-thought Python enthusiast, interested in all things data! I proud myself on having a fast learning curve for technology and being able to combine obtained knowledge to come up with creative and simple solutions.

I am passionate about Transport and Urban Planning, especially how intertwined they are, having significant impact over people's lives, such as: housing, economic growth, mobility/accessibility, cultural identity and place-making.
