# Personal Blog: Sharing the Knowledge/Fun

This project creates my personal blog using Jekyll and free hosting on GitHub Pages. 
Special thanks to:
+ [this amazing video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M) that got me started in the right track;
+ [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), a minimalist but amazing theme.

As a personal sense of realization, I love "giving back", sharing with others what I have enjoyed learning.

As a bonus, I have found it to be an amazing exercise to improve my own learning experience: by simplifying and teaching others,  your own knowledge gaps are placed under the spotlight. This is great for fighting the false sense of learning!

This blog is my online space to write about topics I am interested in, having a good reference source for my "future self" and to point others to (specially the concepts of Practical Statistics!).

Anyone interested in replicating this project, feel free to follow [this post](https://marcellovictorino.github.io/post/Creating-your-personal-blog/) ;)
