# Introduction
Linear Regression is the linear approach to modeling the relationship between a quantitative response ($$y$$) and one or more explanatory variables ($$X$$); also known as Response and Features, respectively.

But it is also possible to implement a variation of Linear Regression in order to capture categorical response - that is, *classes*. For example, the common case of Binary Outcome (i.e. 1 for True and 0 for False) can be represented by the Binomial Logistic Regression. *Which is just a specific case of Multinomial Regression, considering only 2 possible outcomes*.

This post focuses on **Logistic Regression**, its interpretation and overall model performance evaluation.
